# Print the Elements of a Linked List

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topics:** N/A  
**HackerRank URL:** [Print the Elements of a Linked List](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/print-the-elements-of-a-linked-list/problem)

## Problem Description

This challenge is part of a [MyCodeSchool](http://www.youtube.com/mycodeschool) tutorial track and is accompanied by a [video lesson](http://www.youtube.com/embed/vcQIFT79_50?theme=light).

This exercise focuses on traversing a linked list. You are given a pointer to the  node of a linked list. The task is to print the  of each node, one per line. If the head pointer is , indicating the list is empty, nothing should be printed.

**Function Description**

Complete the  function with the following parameter(s):

* : a reference to the head of the list

**Print**

* For each node, print its  value on a new line (console.log in Javascript).

**Input Format**

The first line of input contains , the number of elements in the linked list. **
The next  lines contain one element each, the  values for each node.

Note:** Do not read any input from stdin/console. Complete the printLinkedList function in the editor below.

**Constraints**

*

* , where  is the  element of the linked list.

**Sample Input**

```
STDIN   Function
-----   --------
2       n = 2
16      first data value = 16
13      second data value = 13

```

**Sample Output**

```
16
13

```

**Explanation**

There are two elements in the linked list. They are represented as 16 -> 13 -> NULL. So, the  function should print 16 and 13 each on a new line.

// Language: java8



    // Complete the printLinkedList function below.

    /*
     * For your reference:
     *
     * SinglyLinkedListNode {
     *     int data;
     *     SinglyLinkedListNode next;
     * }
     *
     */
    static void printLinkedList(SinglyLinkedListNode head) {
        while (head != null){
            System.out.println(head.data);
            head = head.next;
        }
