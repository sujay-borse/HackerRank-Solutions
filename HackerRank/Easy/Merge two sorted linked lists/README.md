# Merge two sorted linked lists

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topics:** N/A  
**HackerRank URL:** [Merge two sorted linked lists](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/merge-two-sorted-linked-lists/problem)

## Problem Description

This challenge is part of a tutorial track by [MyCodeSchool](http://www.youtube.com/mycodeschool)

Given pointers to the heads of two sorted linked lists, merge them into a single, sorted linked list. Either head pointer may be null meaning that the corresponding list is empty.

**Example** **
 refers to

 refers to

The new list is

Function Description**

Complete the *mergeLists* function in the editor below.

*mergeLists* has the following parameters:

* *SinglyLinkedListNode pointer headA:* a reference to the head of a list

* *SinglyLinkedListNode pointer headB:* a reference to the head of a list

**Returns**

* *SinglyLinkedListNode pointer:* a reference to the head of the merged list

**Input Format**

The first line contains an integer , the number of test cases.

The format for each test case is as follows:

The first line contains an integer , the length of the first linked list. **
The next  lines contain an integer each, the elements of the linked list.

The next line contains an integer , the length of the second linked list.

The next  lines contain an integer each, the elements of the second linked list.

Constraints**

*

*

* , where  is the  element of the list.

**Sample Input**

```
1
3
1
2
3
2
3
4

```

**Sample Output**

```
1 2 3 3 4

```

**Explanation**

The first linked list is:

The second linked list is:

Hence, the merged linked list is:
