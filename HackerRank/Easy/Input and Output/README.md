# Input and Output

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topics:** N/A  
**HackerRank URL:** [Input and Output](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/cpp-input-and-output/problem)

## Problem Description

**Objective** **
In this challenge, we practice reading input from stdin and printing output to stdout.

In C++, you can read a single whitespace-separated token of input using [cin](http://www.cplusplus.com/cin), and print output to stdout using [cout](http://www.cplusplus.com/printf). For example, let's say we declare the following variables:

```
string s;
int n;

```

and we want to use *cin* to read the input "High 5" from stdin. We can do this with the following code:

```
cin >> s >> n;

```

This reads the first word ("High") from stdin and saves it as string , then reads the second word ("") from stdin and saves it as integer . If we want to print these values to stdout, separated by a space, we write the following code:

```
cout << s << " " << n << endl;

```

This code prints the contents of string , a single space (), then the integer . We end our line of output with a newline using [endl](http://www.cplusplus.com/endl). This results in the following output:

```
High 5

```

Task** **
Read  numbers from stdin and print their sum to stdout.

Input Format**

One line that contains  space-separated integers: , , and .

**Constraints**

*

**Output Format**

Print the sum of the three numbers on a single line.

**Sample Input**

```
1 2 7

```

**Sample Output**

```
10

```

**Explanation**

The sum of the three numbers is .

## Solution

```cpp
// HackerRank Problem: Input and Output
// Link: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/cpp-input-and-output/problem
// Difficulty: Easy
// Language: cpp

#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;


int main() {
    string s;
    int a,b,c,sum;
    cin>>a>>b>>c;
    sum=a+b+c;
    cout<<sum;
    /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT */   
    return 0;
}

```
